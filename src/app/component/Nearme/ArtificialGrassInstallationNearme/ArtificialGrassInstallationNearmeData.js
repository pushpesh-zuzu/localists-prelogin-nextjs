    title: "How long does artificial grass last?",
    description: `
      Generally, high-quality artificial grass installation can last between 15 and 20 years, depending on usage, material quality, and upkeep. Factors such as heavy foot traffic or pets may shorten its lifespan slightly. However, with proper care, most modern synthetic turf installations stay lush and green for decades. For long-lasting results, it’s worth investing in premium turf and hiring professional artificial lawn installers.
      `,
  },
  {
    key: "2",
    title: "Do I need to prepare the ground myself?",
    description: `
      In most cases, no. Professional artificial lawn installers will handle the entire process, from removing old turf or concrete to laying a stable sub-base and weed membrane. However, if you clear furniture, garden décor, or obstacles beforehand, it could help get the process started faster and keep costs lower.
      `,
  },
  {
    key: "3",
    title: "Is artificial grass suitable for pets? ",
    description: `
      Yes! Artificial lawn installation is highly popular with pet owners because it’s durable, non-toxic, and easy to clean. Pet urine drains through the turf, and solid waste can be picked up as usual.
      `,
  },
  {
    key: "4",
    title: "Will it drain properly in heavy rain?",
    description: `
      When fitted correctly, an artificial lawn  drains just as well as natural lawns. Sometimes even better. The base layer of crushed stone or sharp sand allows water to flow away quickly, preventing puddles. 
      </br></br>
      That’s why choosing experienced artificial grass and fitting specialists is important. 
      `,
  },
  {
    key: "5",
    title: "Can you install artificial grass over concrete or decking?",
    description: `
      Yes, it’s possible to lay artificial turf over concrete, tarmac, or decking with the right preparation. Your artificial grass installer may add an underlay for cushioning and drainage, making the surface softer underfoot. This option is ideal for small gardens, balconies, and roof terraces where natural turf isn’t possible.

      When you hire through Localists, you’ll be connected with vetted artificial grass installation specialists who can guide you through every step and answer all your questions with complete transparency.

      `,
  },
  {
    key: "6",
    title: "What’s the difference between synthetic turf and fake grass?",
    description: `
      The terms are often used interchangeably. “Fake grass installation” is just a casual phrase, while “synthetic turf installation” usually refers to more advanced, realistic products often used in sports grounds or premium landscaping projects. Both create a green, low-maintenance lawn, but synthetic turf is generally the higher-quality option.
      `,
  },
  {
    key: "7",
    title: "How do I maintain artificial grass after installation?",
    description: `
      Unlike natural lawns, artificial grass requires very little upkeep. There’s no mowing, fertilising, or reseeding -  just occasional brushing to keep fibres upright, rinsing to remove dust, and clearing away leaves or debris. For pet owners, a quick rinse keeps the lawn hygienic. Most artificial lawn installers will provide aftercare guidance to ensure your turf looks great for years.
