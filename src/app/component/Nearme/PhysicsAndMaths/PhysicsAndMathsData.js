            description: `
      For many people, yes. A good tutor can make a huge difference by breaking things down in a way that finally “clicks.” Instead of spending hours stuck or frustrated, you get someone guiding you through step by step, keeping you motivated, and tailoring the lessons to your pace. The value isn’t just in better grades, it’s also in building confidence and reducing stress, which can be priceless during exam season.

            description: `
      For most students, once a week is a great place to start. It gives you time between sessions to practise what you’ve learned and then come back with questions. If you’re preparing for an important exam or struggling with a subject, you might benefit from two sessions a week for more focused support. Think of it like the gym, progress comes with consistency, so the key is to find a schedule you can stick to.`,

            title: "What grade needs the most tutoring?",
            description: `
      The truth is, tutoring can make a difference at any stage of learning. There isn’t really a single grade that “needs it most”, it’s more about when a student feels they’d benefit from extra support. For some, that might mean building strong foundations early on in primary school. For others, it’s about tackling tricky concepts in secondary school or getting ready for important exams.
        <br />
        That said, there are certain points in education where demand naturally rises. GCSEs and A-Levels are common times for tutoring, since performance in these exams has a big impact on future choices like university and career paths. Some families also look for extra help at Key Stage 2 or 3, before the pressure ramps up, while university students often turn to tutors for help with demanding subjects like Physics and Maths.
        <br />
        In the end, tutoring isn’t about a particular grade — it’s about getting the right support at the right time, whenever it’s needed most.
