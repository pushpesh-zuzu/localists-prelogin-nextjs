        description: `
      The best time to paint really depends on whether you’re working indoors or outdoors. For exterior painting, late spring through early autumn is ideal - the weather’s warmer, the air is drier, and the paint has plenty of time to dry properly. Avoid cold or damp days, as paint won’t adhere well and may peel or bubble later. For interior painting, any time of year works, as long as your space is warm, dry, and well-ventilated.

        title: "Is it cheaper to spray or roll paint?",
        description: `
      It depends on the job. Spray painting covers large areas quickly and gives a super-smooth finish, great for new builds or empty rooms. But it can be more expensive due to setup, masking, and cleanup time. Rolling paint, on the other hand, is usually cheaper and wastes less paint. It’s ideal for smaller rooms or touch-ups where precision matters more than speed.`,
