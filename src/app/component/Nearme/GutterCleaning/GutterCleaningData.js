      Generally, most properties benefit from a gutter clean atleast twice a year. Ideally, once in spring and again in autumn. These are the times when gutters are most likely to get clogged, either from falling blossom, leaves, or seasonal debris.
      <br /><br />
      On the other hand, if your building is close to tall trees, or you live somewhere that gets a lot of rainfall, you might need to do it more often. Regular checks mean you can catch blockages early and avoid the hassle of water damage later.

      The time it takes for gutter clearance really depends on certain factors: the size of the property, the length of the gutters, and how blocked they are. For a small house with fairly clear gutters, the job might take just 30 to 60 minutes.
        <br /><br />
        Larger properties or badly clogged gutters can take a couple of hours, especially if there’s moss to scrape away or tricky access points to deal with. A professional cleaner will usually give you an idea of the time needed once they’ve seen the property.

            description: `
      DIY gutter cleaning might look like a money-saver, but it’s not always the case. Buying or hiring ladders and tools can quickly add up, and without the right safety gear, the risk of falling or damaging your property is high. If you miss hidden issues like leaks, rust, or loose joints, it could cost more to fix later. Hiring a professional usually works out cheaper in the long run because the job is done safely, thoroughly, and with an expert eye for potential problems.`,

            description: `
      The ideal times are usually late autumn, after most leaves have fallen, and early spring, before heavy rainfall begins. Cleaning gutters at these points helps prevent blockages from building up, keeping your gutters clear.
      <br /><br />
      That said, timing isn’t always about the calendar though. If your building is surrounded by trees, or you’ve recently had storms, leaves and debris can accumulate faster than expected. In those cases, it’s worth checking your gutters sooner rather than waiting for the perfect season.

      If gutters aren’t cleaned regularly, leaves, moss, and debris build up and block water flow. This can cause rainwater to overflow, leading to damp walls, mould inside the home, damaged foundations, and even roof leaks. In winter, trapped water can freeze and cause cracks or sagging gutters, which may eventually need costly repairs or replacement.
