Also, in terms of location, specialists in larger cities like Manchester or high-demand areas may charge more than those in rural regions.",

      title: "What is the best time of year for tree surgery?",
      description: `
      Usually, the best time for most tree surgery would be late autumn to early spring, when trees are dormant. With fewer leaves and less sap flow, the work is not only easier on the tree and the tree surgeon, but often cheaper too. Demand is usually lower outside of peak gardening season, so you may be able to save on costs.
      <br /><br />
      Of course, if a tree is diseased, unsafe, or posing a risk, it’s important to act straight away. Don’t wait for the “cheapest” time. Safety should always come first, and a qualified tree surgeon can guide you on the best approach for your situation.

      description: `
      You should start to worry about a tree if you notice signs that it might be unhealthy or unstable. Things like large cracks in the trunk, branches that look dead or brittle, fungus or mushrooms growing around the base, or the tree leaning more than usual are all red flags. Roots lifting pavings, or damaging walls can also be a concern.
      <br /> <br />
      Sometimes the warning signs aren’t that obvious though. For example, rot can be hidden inside the trunk. If you’re unsure, it’s always safer to have a professional tree removal expert take a look. They can quickly tell you whether the tree just needs some pruning, or if it’s a bigger issue that requires urgent action.

      description: `
      Not all trees can be removed freely. If a tree is protected by a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) or is in a conservation area, you’ll need council permission before carrying out work. Cutting down or heavily pruning without approval could lead to hefty fines. If you’re unsure, a tree surgeon can check the status for you and guide you through the process.`,

      Reducing a tree’s height (also called crown reduction) can cost anywhere between <strong>£150 and £500</strong>, depending on the size of the tree, how much needs to be reduced, and where you live. For example, reducing a very tall oak will cost more than trimming back a medium-sized birch. Tree surgeons usually visit first to assess and give a tailored quote.`,
