      Usually, the best time for most tree surgery would be late autumn to early spring, when trees are dormant. With fewer leaves and less sap flow, the work is not only easier on the tree and the tree surgeon, but often cheaper too. Demand is usually lower outside of peak gardening season, so you may be able to save on costs.
      <br /><br />
      Of course, if a tree is diseased, unsafe, or posing a risk, it’s important to act straight away. Don’t wait for the “cheapest” time. Safety should always come first, and a qualified tree surgeon can guide you on the best approach for your situation.

      You should be concerned about a tree if you notice signs such as large dead branches, cracks in the trunk, leaning, root damage, fungus growth, or falling branches. These can indicate that the tree is unhealthy or unsafe and may pose a risk to people or property. A professional tree surgeon can assess the condition and advise on the necessary action.

      In the UK, you can usually cut down trees that are not protected by a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) and are not located within a conservation area.

      The cost of reducing the height of a tree depends on its size, location, and complexity of the job. On average, tree height reduction can range from a few hundred pounds to over a thousand pounds for large or difficult trees. Getting multiple quotes from qualified tree surgeons is the best way to find a fair price.

      Trees that are protected in the UK include those covered by a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) or those located in conservation areas. These protections mean you must get permission from the local council before cutting, pruning, or removing the tree. Protected trees are usually those with significant environmental, historical, or aesthetic value.
