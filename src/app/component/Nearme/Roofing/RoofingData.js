        title: "How much does it cost to install a driveway?",
        description: `
      Driveway installation costs can vary widely depending on the surface material, size of your driveway, your location, and any extra features you’d like. For example, adding drainage, decorative edging, lighting, or electric gates will affect the total price. You can get free quotes from specialists here on Localists once you start your search. Depending on what you need, you’ll be provided a cost breakdown.
      <br /><br />
      As a general rule, the larger the driveway, the lower the cost per square metre — so it’s worth asking for quotes based on your exact dimensions. A typical full installation might cost around £4,500 across the UK and £4,800 in London.
        <br /><br />
    However, on average, here’s what you can expect to pay per square metre in the UK:

        title: "Do you need planning permission for a driveway?",
        description: `
      In most cases, planning permission may not be required to install or replace a driveway. However, if your new driveway is over 5 square metres and uses impermeable materials without a drainage solution, you’ll need permission under UK regulations. Smaller installations, or those using permeable surfaces such as gravel, permeable block paving, or porous asphalt, are generally exempt. If you’re unsure, Localists can connect you with a vetted driveway contractor near you who can advise on the latest rules in your area.

    {
        key: "3",
        title: "How long does it take to build a driveway?",
        description: `
      The time to build a driveway depends on its size, the surface material, and site conditions. On average, most driveway installations take 3 to 7 days from start to finish. For example, gravel driveways are often the quickest to install, while block paving or decorative stonework can take longer due to the precision involved. Weather conditions (especially for concrete), site preparation, and contractor availability can also affect the timeline. Hiring an experienced driveway installer through Localists ensures your project runs smoothly and on schedule.`,

    {
        key: "4",
        title: "Which is the cheapest driveway to install?",
        description: `
      Gravel driveways are generally the most affordable to install, thanks to the low cost of materials and straightforward installation process. They’re also quick to lay and come in a wide range of colours and/or stone sizes. However, what they offer in affordability, they can lack in long-term durability compared to paved options. They do require periodic maintenance, such as topping up the gravel and keeping weeds at bay.`,
