      Always get at least three written quotes so you know what a fair price looks like. Check the roofer’s qualifications, ask for proof of insurance, and read previous client reviews. Never pay the full amount up front. Most reputable roofers or roofing companies will only ask for a deposit and then final payment on completion. Doing these checks can save you a lot of stress and money.

      If you’re looking for a budget-friendly option, asphalt or felt roofing tends to be the most affordable. While it may not offer the longevity of tiles or slate, it’s a solid choice for smaller homes or temporary fixes. Just make sure it’s installed by a qualified roofer to avoid leaks or early wear.Depending on your situation, you can also benefit from government grants.

      As John F Kennedy famously said: the time to repair a roof is when the sun is shining. That being said, if you do notice any small issues with your roof, it’s best to get them sorted straight away to prevent the problems from turning into even bigger problems.  Typically, from late spring to early autumn, the weather is more predictable - fewer rainy days, warmer temperatures, and longer daylight hours make it easier for roofers to work efficiently. However, if you’re looking to save money, consider booking your roof replacement during the off-season, usually in winter. Some roofers offer discounts during these quieter months, though the work may take a bit longer due to weather challenges. Balancing timing, cost, and weather conditions can help you plan the project more effectively.`,
